Step 1: A configured virtual machine (VM) environment that simulates a healthcare network infrastructure. This involves configuring a virtual operating system for the following entities:

Aspirus Hospital

Portage Health Hospital

Baraga County Memorial Hospital (BCMH)

Marquette General Hospital (MGH)

Upper Peninsula Health Information Exchange (UPHIE)

Each virtual machine will act as a standalone system representing one of the healthcare organizations. This environment enables safe testing of network architectures and system developments, helping to identify and resolve issues before implementation in live or cloud-based systems.



Step 2: Setting up and securing OpenEMR
